Did not work as well; applies to kernel outside of VM:

USE THIS! Installs kernel single time only:
In VM, do the following:
wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.11.tar.xz 

May need to do the following:
sudo apt-cache search linux-image
sudo apt-get install linux-image-$version

then follow instructions:
